                    <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
                        instructions, they've
                        moved to their own section. Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation, Native
                        Components, React, and
                        more!</p>

                    <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
                        and the app platform‚Äôs
                        native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well
                        as to describe the
                        appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code.
                        You can learn more about
                        React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                    <p>React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
                        JavaScript. To make the most
                        of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can
                        serve as a refresher
                        course.</p>
                    <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="rf-list_item">components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                            examples: friendly, approachable creatures that
                            need names and a cafe to work in.</li>
                        <li class="rf-list_item">JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                            elements inside JavaScript like so:
                            <Text>Hello, I am your cat!</Text>.
                        </li>
                        <p>The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because
                            JSX is JavaScript, you can
                            use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it
                            with curly braces inside
                            <Text>
                        </p>
                        <li class="rf-list_item">props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</li>
                        <li class="rf-list_item">state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
                            how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs
                            personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that
                            comes from user interaction.
                            State gives your components memory!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="content_item">
                        <h2 class="psevdo-line">handling text input<span class="power">Chapter 4</span></h2>
                        <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop
                            that takes a function to
                            be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to
                            be called when the text is
                            submitted.</p>
                        <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a
                            different language. In this new
                            language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob"
                            would be translated as "üçï
                            üçï".</p>
